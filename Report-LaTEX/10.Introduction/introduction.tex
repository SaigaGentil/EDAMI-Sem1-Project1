Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets by using mathematical algorithms and statistical methods. The main goal of data mining is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure that can be used to solve business problems and real world problems through data analytics.

This process involves implementing algorithms that define rules <TODO: Read more about rules and reference>. These rules are then applied to the data set to discover patterns that can be used to make predictions. The patterns discovered can be used to answer questions about the data set and to solve problems. The patterns discovered can also be used to make predictions about future events. The most common rules used in data mining are association, sequence, classification, clustering, and forecasting. This project will focus mainly on association rules discovery based on closed frequent itemsets.
